Linguafier, a web app that acts like a dictionary BUT with gamification elements such as Attributes (kinda like fire, ice and lightning), Variation (like a class in an RPG), and Rarity (like gacha). It also has a hierarchy map where you can see how it relates to other words.

This app is build using ReactJs, Inertia and Laravel 10
